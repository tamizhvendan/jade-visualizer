Jade-Visualizer
===============
A tiny web-app to visualize how jade templates are getting translated to its equivalent Html content inspired by 
"Try it yourself" in [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com).

I have created this application solely for learning and experimental purpose. It has built using node.js and socket.io.

Positive Criticism and suggesstions are encouraged!
